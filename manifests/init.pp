#
# [*version*]
#
# [*answersfile*]
#
# [*download_dir*]
#
# [*timeout*]
#
# == Examples
#
#   # Install from Puppet Labs servers with all defaults
#   include pe_upgrade
#
#
#   # More customized
#   class { 'pe_upgrade':
#     version      => '2.5.0',
#     answersfile  => "site/answers/${fqdn}-answers.txt",
#     download_dir => 'https://local.site.downloads/puppet-enterprise/2.5.0',
