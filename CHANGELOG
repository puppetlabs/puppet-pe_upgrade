CHANGELOG
=========

2.1.0
-----

2013-10-14

The release adds support for the `installer` parameter in the main pe_upgrade
class.  This allows you to use pe_upgrade as:

```puppet
  class { 'pe_upgrade':
    version => '2.5.3',
    download_dir => 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/pe-builds/released/2.5.3',
    installer => 'puppet-enterprise-2.5.3-ubuntu-10.04-amd64',
  }
```

In order to upgrade PE on distributions and versions of Puppet Enterprise that
this module doesn't support.
